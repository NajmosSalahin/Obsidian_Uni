# Elementary Probability

## Probability
A **numerical measure of uncertainty** of an event of a random experiment is called **probability**.  

**Example:** When tossing a fair coin, the probability of getting a head is $\tfrac{1}{2}$.

### Types of Probability
1. [[#Objective Probability]]
2. [[#Subjective Probability]]

## Objective Probability
Objective probability is based on **mathematical reasoning** or **statistical data**.  

**Example:** The probability of drawing a red card from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is $\tfrac{26}{52} = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

### Subtypes of Objective Probability
1. [[#Classical Probability|Classical or Mathematical Probability]]
2. [[#Empirical Probability|Empirical / Statistical / Frequency Probability]]

---
## Subjective Probability
Subjective probability is based on **personal judgment, intuition, or belief**, rather than statistical evidence.  

**Example:** A doctor may assign a 70% chance of recovery to a patient based on experience, even without exact statistical data.

## Classical Probability
**Definition:**  
Classical probability (also called mathematical probability) is defined when all outcomes of an experiment are **equally likely** and **finite**. It is given by:  

$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$

**Example:**  
When tossing a fair die, the probability of getting a **4** is:  

$P(\text{4}) = \frac{1}{6}$

since there is 1 favourable outcome (getting a 4) out of 6 possible equally likely outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).


**Experiment:** Experiment is an act that can be repeated under given conditions.
 **Example:**
  * Coin tossing
 

Experiments may be:  
1. **Deterministic (Predictable) Experiment**  
   - The experiment is called deterministic when the outcome or result is unique or certain.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - For a perfect gas, if $P$ = pressure and $V$ = volume and temperature is constant:  
       $PV = \text{constant}$  
     - If $H$ = hydrogen and $O$ = oxygen then,  
       $H + O_2 \to H_2O$ (water)  

2. **Random (Unpredictable) Experiment**  
   - A experiment is called random experiment whose outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty.  
   - Examples:  
     - In tossing a coin one is not sure if a head or a tail will be obtained. 
     * If a light-tube has lasted for t hours, nothing can be said about its further life. It may fail to function at any moment.

##### [Trial](#trial)  
A trial is an experiment or an action that results in one or more outcomes  
 Example: 
 * Tossing a coin once is a trial. Throwing a dice once is also a trial.
##### [Outcomes](#outcomes)  
**Outcomes** are the possible results or observations that can occur from a trial in an experiment.  

##### [Event](#event)  
An **event** is a subset of the sample space, constituting a collection of possible outcomes of a trial.  

##### [Equally Likely Outcomes](#equally-likely-outcomes)  
Outcomes in a sample space that have the **same probability** of occurring.  

##### [Mutually Exclusive Outcomes](#mutually-exclusive-outcomes)  
Outcomes (or events) that **cannot occur simultaneously** in a single trial.  

##### [Favourable Outcomes](#favourable-outcomes)  
The outcomes in the sample space that satisfy the condition defining a particular event.  

##### [Exhaustive Outcomes](#exhaustive-outcomes)  
A set of outcomes that **cover all possible results** in the sample space, with no omissions.  

**Classical or Mathmatical or Priori Probability:**
 If there are n mutually exclusive, equally likely and exhaustive outcome of a random event and if m of those outcomes are favourable to an event A which is denoted 

$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes to event {A} }}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{m}{n}$
