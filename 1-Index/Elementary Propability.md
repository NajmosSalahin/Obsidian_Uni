# Elementary Probability

## Probability
A **numerical measure of uncertainty** of an event of a random experiment is called **probability**.  

**Example:** When tossing a fair coin, the probability of getting a head is $\tfrac{1}{2}$.

### Types of Probability
1. [[#Objective Probability]]
2. [[#Subjective Probability]]

---

## Objective Probability
Objective probability is based on **mathematical reasoning** or **statistical data**.  

**Example:** The probability of drawing a red card from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is $\tfrac{26}{52} = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

### Subtypes of Objective Probability
1. [[#Classical Probability|Classical or Mathematical Probability]]
2. [[#Empirical Probability|Empirical / Statistical / Frequency Probability]]

---
## Subjective Probability
Subjective probability is based on **personal judgment, intuition, or belief**, rather than statistical evidence.  

**Example:** A doctor may assign a 70% chance of recovery to a patient based on experience, even without exact statistical data.

## Classical Probability
**Experiment:** An act that can be repeated under given conditions.  

Experiments may be:  
1. **Deterministic (Predictable) Experiment**  
   - The outcome is unique or certain.  
   - Examples:  
     - For a perfect gas, if $P$ = pressure and $V$ = volume (temperature constant):  
       $PV = \text{constant}$  
     - If $H$ = hydrogen and $O$ = oxygen:  
       $H + O_2 \to H_2O$ (water)  

2. **Random (Unpredictable) Experiment**  
   - Outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty.  
   - Examples:  
     - Tossing a coin → unsure if head or tail.  
     - A light-tube after $t$ hours → may fail anytime.

## Trial
A **trial** is a single performance of a random experiment, resulting in one outcome.  

## Outcomes
**Outcomes** are the possible results or observations from a trial in an experiment.  

## Event
An **event** is a subset of the sample space, consisting of one or more outcomes that satisfy a specific condition.  

## Equally Likely Outcomes
**Equally likely outcomes** are outcomes in a sample space that have the same probability of occurring.  

## Mutually Exclusive Outcomes
**Mutually exclusive outcomes** (or events) are those that **cannot occur simultaneously** in a single trial.  

## Favourable Outcomes
**Favourable outcomes** are the outcomes in the sample space that satisfy the condition defining a particular event.  

## Exhaustive Outcomes
**Exhaustive outcomes** are a set of outcomes that cover **all possible results** in the sample space, with no omissions.
