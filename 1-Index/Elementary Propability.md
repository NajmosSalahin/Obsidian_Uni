# Elementary Probability
#### Probability: 
A numerical measure of uncertainty of an event of a random experiment is called probability.
 *Example:* When tossing a fair coin, the probability of getting a head is $\frac{1}{2}$
##### Probability is divided into 2 parts:
1. Objective Probability
2. Subjective Probability.

##### *Objective Probability*: Objective probability is based on mathematical reasoning or statistical data.
 *Example*: The probability of drawing a red card from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards is $\frac{26}{52}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$

#### Objective Probability is divided into 2 parts:
       i) Classical or mathematical probability;
       ii) Empirical or statistical or frequency probability;
   

Subjective Probability: Subjective probability is based on personal judgment, intuition, or belief rather than statistical evidence.
 Example: A doctor may assign a 70% chance of recovery to a patient based on experience, even though exact statistical data may not be available.

   
So, The Probabilities are:
i) Classical or mathematical probability;
ii) Empirical or statistical or frequency probability;
iii) Subjective probability and
iv) Axiomatic probability.

## Classical Probability:
  Experiment: Experiment is an act that can be repeated under given conditions.
    Experiment may be: 
      i) Deterministic or predictable Experiment and
      ii) Random or Unpredictable Experiment.
Deterministic Experiment: 
 The experiment is called deterministic when the outcome or result is unique or certain.
 (a) For a perfect gas, if P is pressure and V is volume ;Provided the temperature remains constant.
               PV = constant
 (b) If H is the hydrogen and O is the oxygen, then
 H +02 = H20 = water

Random Experiment:
 A experiment is called random experiment whose outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty.
 (i) In tossing a coin one is not sure if a head or a tail will be obtained.
 (ii) If a light-tube has lasted for t hours, nothing can be said about its further life. It may fail to function at any moment.

##### Trial:
A trial is a single performance or execution of a random experiment, resulting in one outcome

##### Outcomes: 
Outcomes are the possible results or observations that can occur from a trial in an experiment.

##### Event:
An event is a subset of the sample space, consisting of one or more outcomes that satisfy a specific condition

##### Equally likely outcomes: 
Equally likely outcomes are outcomes in a sample space that have the same probability of occurring.

##### Mutually Exclusive Outcomes

Mutually exclusive outcomes (or events) are those that cannot occur simultaneously in a single trial.

##### Favourable Outcomes

Favourable outcomes are the outcomes in the sample space that satisfy the condition defining a particular event

##### Exhaustive Outcomes

Exhaustive outcomes are a set of outcomes that cover all possible results in the sample space, with no omissions.
