# ðŸŒ± Introduction to Statistics and Data Science

## Main Note
**Statistics** is the science concerned with [[data collection]], [[data organization]], [[data analysis]], and [[interpretation of data]]. It provides the foundation for reasoning with [[uncertainty]] and making informed decisions.  

**Data Science** extends statistics by integrating [[computational tools]], [[programming]], and domain expertise. It emphasizes [[large-scale data handling]], [[predictive modeling]], and practical application in diverse fields.  

Together, these fields form the backbone of **evidence-based decision-making** in academia, industry, and research. Statistics provides the *theoretical principles*, while data science translates them into *applied workflows and algorithms*.  

Key bridges between the two:  
- **Inferential Statistics â†’ [[Machine Learning]]**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis â†’ [[Data Visualization]]**  
- **Probability â†’ [[Risk Modeling and Forecasting]]**

## Key Points
- [[Statistics]] = theory & methods for data reasoning  
- [[Data Science]] = application of statistics + computation  
- Core stages: [[Data Science Workflow]]  
- Data types: [[Types of Data]]  
- Ethics: [[privacy]], [[bias]], [[fairness]]

## Example
Suppose a university collects data on studentsâ€™ **study hours** and **exam scores**:  
- **Statistics**: Estimate average study hours, calculate correlation, test if study time predicts scores.  
- **Data Science**: Train a [[regression model]] or [[machine learning model]] to *predict future exam scores* from study patterns.
