# üå± STAT-1101 Tutorial Practice

## Main Note
# 1.Define Statistics with suitable example. Describe the types of statistics with suitable example.
## Statistics

**Definition:**  
Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, presentation, analysis, and interpretation of numerical data.

**Example:**  
Suppose a teacher records the marks of 100 students in Mathematics. Analyzing each student‚Äôs mark individually is difficult. Instead, the teacher can calculate the **average mark (mean)**, the **highest and lowest marks**, and the **distribution of grades**. This summary makes the data easier to understand.

## Types of Statistics

Statistics is broadly divided into two main types:

### 1\. Descriptive Statistics

- **Definition:** Descriptive statistics refers to methods of summarizing and describing the important features of a dataset.
- It involves **collection, classification, tabulation, and graphical representation** of data, as well as calculation of measures such as **mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation**.


**Example:**  
If we collect the heights of 50 students in a class and find that:

- The average height is **165 cm**
- The tallest student is **178 cm**
- The shortest student is **150 cm**

These results are **descriptive statistics**, since they simply describe the data collected.

### 2\. Inferential Statistics

- **Definition:** Inferential statistics refers to the methods of making predictions, decisions, or generalizations about a population based on a sample of data.
- It involves techniques such as **hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, correlation, and regression analysis**.

**Example:**  
A company wants to know the average salary of all its 10,000 employees. Instead of collecting data from every employee, it selects a **random sample of 200 employees**. Based on this sample, the company estimates the average salary of the entire workforce. This process of making generalizations from a sample is **inferential statistics**.

### Characteristics of Statistics

Statistics, as a scientific discipline, possesses several key characteristics that distinguish it from mere data collection. These features ensure its reliability and applicability in decision-making processes. The main characteristics are as follows:

1. **Aggregate of Facts**: Statistics deals with groups or aggregates of data rather than individual observations. A single fact, such as the height of one person, is not statistics; however, the average height of 100 students constitutes statistics.
2. **Affected by Multiplicity of Causes**: Statistical data is influenced by multiple factors simultaneously. For instance, crop yield is affected by rainfall, soil quality, fertilizers, and pests, not just one cause.
3. **Numerically Expressed**: Statistics must be expressed in quantitative terms for precision and comparability. Qualitative descriptions like "good" or "bad" are not statistical unless quantified, e.g., "80% satisfaction rate."
4. **Enumerated or Estimated with Reasonable Accuracy**: Data is collected through enumeration (complete count) or estimation (sampling) with a standard degree of accuracy to minimize errors. For example, a census enumerates the entire population, while surveys estimate based on samples.
5. **Collected Systematically**: The data collection process must be planned and methodical to avoid bias. Random or haphazard collection, such as polling only friends for opinions, would invalidate the statistics.
6. **Collected for a Predetermined Purpose**: Statistics are gathered with a specific objective in mind, ensuring relevance. For example, economic statistics are collected to analyze GDP growth for policy formulation.
7. **Placed in Relation to Each Other**: Statistical facts must be comparable and interrelated. Data on income levels across different years becomes meaningful when compared to inflation rates.

These characteristics make statistics a tool for objective analysis rather than subjective interpretation.

### Scope of Statistics

The scope of statistics is vast and interdisciplinary, extending beyond mathematics to various fields where data-driven insights are essential. It encompasses both theoretical foundations and practical applications, enabling the handling of uncertainty in real-world scenarios. Broadly, the scope can be divided into the following areas:

1. **Nature and Subject Matter**: Statistics includes descriptive statistics (summarizing data) and inferential statistics (drawing conclusions from samples). It deals with probability theory, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, forming the basis for quantitative research.
2. **Application in Various Fields**:
	- **Economics and Business**: Used for market analysis, forecasting demand, and financial modeling, e.g., calculating inflation rates or stock market trends.
	- **Science and Medicine**: Applied in experimental design, clinical trials, and epidemiology, such as determining the efficacy of a vaccine through statistical tests.
	- **Social Sciences**: Helps in demographic studies, opinion polls, and sociology, e.g., analyzing crime rates or population growth.
	- **Government and Planning**: Essential for policy-making, budgeting, and census operations, like using vital statistics for resource allocation.
	- **Industry and Engineering**: Employed in quality control, reliability testing, and operations research, such as Six Sigma methods to reduce defects.
	- **Education and Research**: Facilitates grading systems, educational assessments, and empirical studies across disciplines.
3. **Limitations and Extensions**: While statistics aids in decision-making under uncertainty, its scope is limited by data quality and assumptions (e.g., it cannot predict with 100% certainty). Modern extensions include big data analytics, machine learning, and bioinformatics, broadening its role in emerging technologies.

# 3.What are the limitations and uses of statistics?
## Uses of Statistics

Statistics has a wide range of applications in different fields. Its major uses are:

1. **Simplifies Complex Data**
	- Large data can be simplified into tables, graphs, averages, and percentages.
	- Example: Population census data is summarized into literacy rates, sex ratio, etc.
2. **Helps in Comparison**
	- Data presented in averages, ratios, or percentages makes comparison easier.
	- Example: Comparing literacy rate of Bangladesh with India.
3. **Assists in Forecasting**
	- Based on past data, future trends can be predicted.
	- Example: Predicting future sales from past sales records.
4. **Aids in Decision Making**
	- Provides a scientific basis for decisions in business, economics, and government policies.
	- Example: Government uses statistical surveys to decide poverty-alleviation programs.
5. **Measures Uncertainty**
	- With probability and sampling theory, statistics helps to estimate risks and chances.
	- Example: Insurance companies use statistics to calculate premium rates.
6. **Useful in Research**
	- Statistical tools are essential in designing experiments, testing hypotheses, and verifying results.
	- Example: Testing effectiveness of a new medicine.
7. **Applications in Everyday Life**
	- People use statistics in budgeting, investment, and choosing among alternatives.
	- Example: A family compares monthly expenses to control overspending.

## Limitations of Statistics

Although useful, statistics has certain limitations:

1. **Deals with Numerical Data Only**
	- Statistics cannot study qualitative aspects like honesty, beauty, or intelligence directly.
	- Example: We can measure marks of students but not their sincerity.
2. **Does Not Provide Exact Results**
	- Results are approximate, expressed as averages or estimates, not exact values.
	- Example: Average income may not represent every individual‚Äôs income.
3. **Cannot Establish Cause and Effect**
	- Statistics can show correlation but not definite causation.
	- Example: Ice-cream sales and drowning cases both rise in summer, but one does not cause the other.
4. **Can Be Misused**
	- Wrong methods of data collection or biased presentation can mislead.
	- Example: A company showing only favorable survey results to attract investors.
5. **Requires Expertise**
	- Proper knowledge is needed to collect, analyze, and interpret data correctly.
	- Example: Wrong choice of average (mean/median/mode) can give false conclusions.
6. **Depends on Data Accuracy**
	- ‚ÄúBad data leads to bad statistics.‚Äù If collected data is inaccurate, results will also be unreliable.
	- Example: Wrong census data can misguide government policies.
