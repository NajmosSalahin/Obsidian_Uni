What Is Economics?

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.</mark> The study of economics is primarily concerned with analyzing the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make to allocate limited resources.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Lionel Robbins said the following about the subject: “Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.”</mark>

What is Microeconomics?

The term microeconomics is derived from the Greek word *‘mikros’* meaning ‘small.’ The microeconomics deals with the analysis of small individual units of individual firms and small aggregate or groups of individual units such as various industries and markets.

According to Prof. K. E. Boulding. “Microeconomics deals with the study of individual enterprises, particular homes, individual price, stipend, income, individual diligence, and particular goods.”

What is Macroeconomics?

The term macroeconomics is derived from the Greek word *‘makros’meaning‘large.’ The macroeconomics concerns itself with the analysis of the economy as a whole and its large aggregates such as total output and income, total employment, total consumption, aggregate investment.

According to K.E.Boulding “Macroeconomics deals not with individual quantities as such put with the aggregates of these quantities not with individual incomes but with the national income; not with individual output but with the national output.”

In the previous sections, we have understood micro and macroeconomics in detail. 

Scarcity:Scarcity is the conditionthat exists when there is an insufficient quantity of resources to produce all the goods derived by people. We can say another way; scarcity derives from the combination of limited resources and unlimited wants.

Opportunity cost:The opportunity cost of a particular action is the loss of next best alternative that is a sacrificed opportunity is called an opportunity cost.

Production possibility curve:Production possibility curve is a curve representing the maximum possible output combinations of goods that can be produced with a fixed quantity of resources and current level of technology.

Production Possibility Curve (PPC) on a National Scale:

Imagine a national economy that can produce only two things: wine and cotton. If points A, B, and C are plotted on a curve, it represents the economy’s most efficient use of resources. 

![Image](Aspose.Words.199a4c97-ee6b-4bb4-a97a-8967653eadf6.001.jpeg)

For instance, producing five units of wine and five units of cotton (point B) is just as attainable as producing three units of wine and seven units of cotton. Point X represents an inefficient use of resources, while point Y represents a goal that the economy simply cannot attain with its present levels of resources. 

As we can see, for this economy to produce more wine, it must give up some of the resources it is currently using to produce cotton (point A). If the economy starts producing more cotton (represented by points B and C), it would need to divert resources from making wine and, consequently, will produce less wine than it is producing at point A. 

Moreover, by moving production from point A to B, the economy must decrease wine production by a small amount compared to the increase in cotton output. But if the economy moves from point B to C, wine output will be reduced by about 50%, while the cotton output only increases by about 75%. 

Keep in mind that A, B, and C all represent the most efficient allocation of resources for the economy. The nation must decide how to achieve the PPF and which combination to use. For example, if more wine is in demand, the cost of increasing its output is proportional to the cost of decreasing cotton production. Markets play an important role in telling the economy what the PPF should look like. 

Positive Economics:

Positive economics is the branch of economics that concerns the description and explanation of economic phenomena. It focuses on facts and cause and effect behavioral relationship includes the development and testing of economics theories. Earlier terms were value free economics. 

Understanding Positive Economics:

Positive economics is about describing how things actually are without making any value judgements. For example, if the government has introduced a new road tax to decrease traffic congestion, then positive economics will describe the actual effect of this road tax on motorists and traffic congestion. It may describe that:

- The government has introduced a road tax of $10 for all motorists passing a certain road.
- This road tax has reduced the number of motorists on that road by 20%.
- Traffic congestion is reduced on that particular road.
- The travel time for motorists is reduced.

All these points show a descriptive and objective approach to discussing what is actually happening as a result of introducing the new road tax. There are no opinions or value judgements made. This is the approach to describing economic phenomena used by positive economists.



Normative Economics:

Normative economics is a plant of economics that expresses value or normative judgements about economic fairness or what the outcome of the economy or goals public policy ought to be.   

Understanding Normative Economics:

Normative economics is about making opinions and value judgements about economic policies or outcomes. For example, if the government has introduced a new road tax to decrease traffic congestion, then normative economics will form opinions about this tax based on ethical, moral, and social values. The above example of normative economics may describe that:

- The government is right to introduce a road tax of $10 on all motorists passing a certain road.
- This road tax is harmful for motorists.
- This road tax is beneficial for the government.
- The government should not impose the road tax.
- The government is wrong in imposing the road tax.

All these points show value judgements and opinions about the road tax. This is the approach to describing various economic phenomena used by normative economists.

Factors of Production:

Anything that helps in production is the factor of production. These are the various factors by mean any resource is transformed into a more useful commodity or service.

They are the inputs for the process of production. They are the starting point of the production process. Factors of production are the parameters which affect the output of production.

` `Types of Factors of Production

Factors of production have been categorized into four types.

![factors of production](Aspose.Words.199a4c97-ee6b-4bb4-a97a-8967653eadf6.002.png)



Land

It refers to all natural resources. All natural resources either on the surface of the earth or below the surface of the earth or above the surface of the earth is Land.

One uses the land to produces goods. It is the primary and natural factor of production. All gifts of nature such as rivers, oceans, land, climate, mountains, mines, forests etc. are land.

The payment for land is rent.

Characteristics of Land as a Factor of Production

- The land is a free gift of nature.
- ` `The land has no cost of production.
- It is immobile.
- The land is fixed and limited in supply.

Types of Land

1. Residential
1. Commercial
1. Recreation
1. Cultivation
1. Extraction
1. Uninhabitable

Labor

All human effort that assists in production is labour. This effort can be mental or physical. It is a human factor of production. It is the worker who applies their efforts, abilities, and skills to produce.

The payment for labour is the wage.

**Characteristic**

- It is a human factor.
- One cannot store labour.
- No two types of labour are the same.

**Types of Labor**

1. Unskilled
1. Semi-skilled
1. Skilled
1. Professional

Capital

Capital refers to all manmade resources used in the production process. It is a produced factor of production. It includes factories, machinery, tools, equipment, raw materials, wealth etc.

The payment for capital is interest.

**Characteristics**

- Capital is a manmade factor of production.
- It is mobile.
- It is a passive factor of production.

**Types o  f Capital**

1. Fixed
1. Working
1. Venture

Entrepreneur

An entrepreneur is a person who brings other factors of production in one place. He uses them for the production process. He is the person who decides

- What to produce
- Where to produce
- How to produce

A person who takes these decisions along with the associated risk is an entrepreneur.

The payment for land is profit.

**Characteristics**

- He has imagination.
- He has great administrative power.
- An entrepreneur must be a man of action.
- An entrepreneur must have the ability to organize.
- He should be a knowledgeable person.
- He must have a professional approach.


  Basic Problem of our economy:

  The basic problems of an economy often emerge from the necessity to make decisions due to limited means. This problem emerges because people have endless desires, yet the means open to meet those desires are limited. Consequently, meeting all human desires becomes difficult when faced with limited resources.

  If resources were infinite or had only a singular goal, the economic problem might not exist. However, whether its natural resources, man-made wealth, market goods, money, or time, scarcity remains the core problem. 

- ## 1. What to Produce?
- This means that society must decide which goods and in what quantities should be produced. A common example of this problem is often described as the choice between “guns or butter,” stressing the decision society faces due to the shortage of resources. However, the decision-making problem goes beyond the division of military and civilian things.
- Society must also make choices among different market goods, choosing how resources are shared among them. Particularly important in this context is the choice between basics and pleasures. Additionally, a vital decision in the production of goods and resource sharing includes choosing the amounts of both consumer goods and capital goods to be created. 
- ## 2. How to Produce?
- This shows the decision a society makes regarding the mix of materials to produce things. The mix of materials suggests a particular production process. Typically, there are various different ways of production, and society must make a selection among them. Each method uses a different mix of resources, such as labor and cash. For instance, cotton cloth can be made using either a handloom or different ways. 
- ## 3. For Whom to Produce?
- Determining consumers of public resources includes choosing how these goods should be divided among the members of society. Given the scarcity of useful resources and the resulting limited production, it is impossible to meet all the wants of every person. Consequently, society must make choices about the division of the total output of work and things among its members.
- In a free economy, the sharing of the public output is set by people’s monetary wages. The amount of public goods an individual can gain from the market is directly linked to their financial income. Thus, the bigger an individual’s monetary income, the more things they can buy. Consequently, bigger differences in the distribution of monetary earnings lead to greater inequalities in the distribution of public goods. 
- ## 4.What to Do for Economic Growth?
- Can a society afford to use all its resources for immediate consumption? Well, yes, it could be possible, but unlikely. The reasoning is simple: a society that would consume all the resources to the current consumption would hinder the growth of production capacity.
- As a result, the standard of living and the wealth of a person within the society would be maintained. It would also reduce living standards in future. As such, society must choose the share of resources that it plans to set aside towards future developments. 
- ## Free Price Mechanism to Solve Basic Problems of an Economy
- The price mechanism is a method of shaping the choices made by people in an economy by counting on prices set through the exchange of demand and supply in the market.
- This method works independently of government meddling. When market forces of demand and supply reach equilibrium—where the quantity given equals the amount demanded—the price of a product is set.
- The price system not only helps in determining the cost of things but also plays a crucial role in allocating resources, leading spending and production choices, and setting amounts of savings and factor income. This method is mainly noticed in a capitalist economic context. 

# What are merit goods, demerit goods and public goods?
Merit goods are the goods that are provided generally by the government to certain sections of the society. Unlike in the case of pure public goods, the merit goods are not provided to the entire society; rather they are given to certain targeted people. The government here believes that the deserving people may *under-consume* such goods and hence provides these to them at low cost or no cost.

**Merit goods and Social goods**

The concept of merit goods in economics was introduced by an American economist Richard A. Musgrave. Musgrave was a leading public finance specialist. He divided public goods or wants into social goods (wants) and merit goods (wants).

Social goods: are goods with non-exclusion principle and their supply is jointly made.

Merit goods: are those public goods which results in interference with consumer choices. Here the government will be providing the goods (merit) to specific section of the society because of their backward status, poverty etc (depending on their merit).

An example for merit goods or wants is the government’s expenditure in the educational sector (like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) for the schooling of the poor. The comparison between the social wants and merit wants is simple.  In the case of social wants, the goods are provided to all sections of the society (road, defense). In the case of merit wants, the good is provided to certain target groups.

Poor people may under-consume most of the merit goods because of their inability to pay. To counter this under consumption, the government either subsidises them or makes them completely free.  In this way, consumption does not depend on the ability to pay of the consumer.

**Features of Merit Goods;**

1. Merit goods are not provided on the basis of consumer’s preference. Rather, they are given by the government on its own preferences.
1. Merit goods are given by the government for a particular section of the society. But ion the case of public goods, they are provided to all sections of the society.
1. Merit goods produces social benefit by directly benefiting the sections that receive those goods. When primary education is provided to poor sections, it benefits the nation.
1. Merit goods produces positive externalities. This means that as a result of merit goods supply, the receivers give backs some related benefits to the society.
1. Merit goods are aimed for personal consumption and not for the consumption of all.

**Examples for merit goods**

Merit goods include primary education, basic health care, life insurance to poor people etc. The merit goods under two categories- Merit I and Merit II, in terms of their priority.

**Merit I –** Elementary education, primary healthcare, prevention and control of diseases, social welfare and nutrition, soil and water conservation, ecology, and environment.

**Merit II –** Education (other than elementary), sports and youth services, family welfare, urban development, forestry, agricultural research and education, other agricultural programmes, special programmes for rural development, land reforms, other rural development programmes, special programmes for north-eastern areas, flood control and drainage, non-convention energy, village and small industries, ports and light houses, roads and bridges, inland water transport, atomic energy research, space research, oceanographic research, other scientific research, census surveys and statistics, and meteorology.

**Non-Merit –** All others.

**What are demerit goods?**

A demerit good is a good whose consumption leaves a negative impact on its consumer and on others in the society. An example for demerit good is alcohol. Consumption of alcohol can cause health problems for the drinker. Besides this personal cost, it also leads to external costs as the taxpayer may have to pay for the drunkard consumer’s healthcare as a result. If it is over consumed the marginal social costs exceed marginal private(drunkard’s) costs, due to the external costs imposed on society. Hence a high tax should be imposed on de-merit goods.

**Difference between merit goods and public goods**

Public goods are provided to the entire society. Merit goods are provided to targeted individuals. Hence in the case of merit goods, there is exclusion. On the other goods, there is no exclusion under public goods.

**What are public goods?**

Public goods refer to those goods which satisfy public wants. The main attribute of public good is that they are supplied by the government jointly for the entire public.

Main features of public goods are non-exclusion, non-rivalry and indivisibility.

Principle of *non-exclusion*: in the case of public goods, they ate collectively supplied to all sections of the community.

Principle of Indivisibility: in the case of public goods, they are *indivisible* i.e., they cannot be divided to confine the supply to a selected people.

Non-rivalry: consumption of public goods is *non-rival*. This means that the use of public goods some people doesn’t reduce its availability to others.

Examples for public goods are defense services, pollution control, streetlight etc.




What is Market Failure?

Market failure refers to the inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. In a typical free market, the prices of goods and services are determined by the forces of supply and demand, and any change in one of the forces results in a price change and a corresponding change in the other force. The changes lead to a price equilibrium.

**Causes of Market Failures**

Market failure may occur in the market for several reasons, including:

**1. Externality**

An externality refers to a cost or benefit resulting from a transaction that affects a third party that did not decide to be associated with the benefit or cost. It can be positive or negative. A positive externality provides a positive effect on the third party. F or example, providing good public education mainly benefits the students, but the benefits of this public good will spill over to the whole society.

On the other hand, a negative externality is a negative effect resulting from the consumption of a product, and that results in a negative impact on a third party. For example, even though cigarette smoking is primarily harmful to a smoker, it also causes a negative health impact on people around the smoker.

**2. Public goods**

Public goods are goods that are consumed by a large number of the population, and their cost does not increase with the increase in the number of consumers. Public goods are both non-rivalrous as well as non-excludable. Non-rivalrous consumption means that the goods are allocated efficiently to the whole population if provided at zero cost, while non-excludable consumption means that the public goods cannot exclude non-payers from its consumption.

Public goods create market failures if a section of the population that consumes the goods fails to pay but continues using the good as actual payers. For example, police service is a public good that every citizen is entitled to enjoy, regardless of whether or not they pay taxes to the government.

**3. Market control**

Market control occurs when either the buyer or the seller possesses the power to determine the price of goods or services in a market. The power prevents the natural forces of demand and supply from setting the prices of goods in the market.

On the supply side, the sellers may control the prices of goods and services if there are only a few large sellers (oligopoly) or a single large seller (monopoly). The sellers may collude to set higher prices to maximize their returns. The sellers may also control the quantity of goods produced in the market and may collude to create scarcity and increase the prices of commodities.

On the demand side, the buyers possess the power to control the prices of goods if the market only comprises a single large buyer (monopsony) or a few large buyers (oligopsony). If there is only a single or a handful of large buyers, the buyers may exercise their dominance by colluding to set the price at which they are willing to buy the products from the producers. The practice prevents the market from equating the supply of goods and services to their demand.

**4. Imperfect information in the market**

Market failure may also result from the lack of appropriate information among the buyers or sellers. This means that the price of demand or supply does not reflect all the benefits or opportunity cost of a good. The lack of information on the buyer’s side may mean that the buyer may be willing to pay a higher or lower price for the product because they don’t know its actual benefits.

On the other hand, inadequate information on the seller’s side may mean that they may be willing to accept a higher or lower price for the product than the actual opportunity cost of producing it.

**Solutions to Market Failures**

In order to eliminate market failures, several remedies can be implemented. They include:

**1. Use of legislation**

One of the ways that governments can manage market failures is by implementing legislation that changes behavior. For example, the government can ban cars from operating in city centers, or impose high penalties to businesses that sell alcohol to underage children, since the measures control unwanted behaviors.

**2. Price mechanism**

Price mechanisms are designed to change the behavior of both the consumers and producers. For products that cause harm to consumers, the government can discourage their consumption by increasing taxes. For example, taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are periodically increased to discourage their consumption and reduce their harmful effects on unrelated third parties.

Economic system

Economic system - An economic system is a mechanism used by communities or governments to coordinate and allocate wealth, resources, and commodities within a territory or nation.

What Are the 3 Basic Types of Economies?

There are three main types of economic systems known as economies: a command economy, a market economy and a mixed economy. An understanding of the differences in types of economies can help you decide how to deep dive into a potential career working in the field of economics:

- Command Economy – A command economy is an economy in which the government controls all economic activity and transactions. A country with a communist government is an example of a command economy.
- Market Economy – A market economy is free of all government control. “The economic outcomes are determined by the market forces and the so called ‘invisible hand,’ to use a term coined by philosopher Adam Smith,” Yates said. The invisible hand is a metaphor commonly-used among economists to describe how market forces work together.
- Mixed Economy – This is a hybrid between the command and market economic systems. A mixed economy can be more command or more mixed depending on the government in question. “Most economies in the world are mixed economies, including the United States,” Yates said.

Which economic system is best and why?

Yates said that most economists favor a market-based economy where the price system determines the outcomes of all market transactions. “In a market-based system, every player enters voluntarily in the transactions if they agree on the price,” she said. 

The government sometimes intervenes in the economy to resolve inefficiencies caused by two factors, according to Yates:

- Externalities – These include positive or negative effects caused by transactions, such as pollution caused by driving cars.
- Inequalities – These include situations such as lower wage earners not being able to afford rents, so the government may intervene with rent control or subsidies. Similarly, the government may intervene with unemployment or disability benefits when someone loses their job or is otherwise unable to work.

“Most economies either have a mixed market system or are migrating toward one, like Bangladesh," she said. She feels this is an indication that a mixed market system seems to work the best.



What is Demand?

**Demand:** is the quantity of consumers who are willing and able to buy products at various prices during a given period of time. Demand for any commodity implies the consumers' desire to acquire the good, the willingness and ability to pay for it.

Or,

**Demand**: The demand for a commodity is the amount of it that a consumer will purchase or will be ready to take off from the market at various given prices during a specified time period. This time period may be a day, a week, a month, a year or any given time period.

### **What are the four types of demand?**
** 1. Price Demand**:** The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices, holding other factors constant.

2\. Income Demand: The quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing to buy based on their income levels.

3\. Cross Demand: The quantity of a good that consumers demand based on the price changes of related goods (substitutes and complements).

4\. Market Demand: The total quantity of a good or service that all consumers in a market are willing and able to buy at various prices.

# Causes of Downward Slope
**Downward sloping of demand curve**-The demand of a product refers to the desire of acquiring it by the consumer but backed by his purchasing power and willingness to pay the price. The law of demand states that there is an inverse proportional relationship between price and demand of a commodity. When the price of commodity increases, its demand decreases.

Similarly, when the price of a commodity decreases its demand increases. The law of demand assumes that the other factors affecting the demand of a commodity remain the same.

Thus, the demand curve is downward sloping from left to right. Let us discuss in detail why demand curve slopes downward.
## Why Demand Curve Slopes Downward?
There may be various reasons for the falling nature or downward sloping of demand curve. Some of them are as follows:

## Causes of Downward Sloping of Demand Curve
- Law of diminishing the marginal utility
- Substitution effect
- Income effect
- New buyers
- Old buyers
### **1. Law of diminishing the marginal utility**
The law of diminishing marginal utility states that with each increasing quantity of the commodity, its marginal utility declines.

For example, when a person is very hungry the first chapatti that he eats will give him the most satisfaction. As he will consume more chapattis, his level of satisfaction will diminish.

Thus, when the quantity of goods is more, the marginal utility of the commodity is less. Thus, the consumer is not willing to pay more prices for the commodity and its demand will decline.

Also, when the price of the commodity is low, its demand increases.

Hence, the demand curve slopes downwards from left to right.
### **2. Substitution effect**
Let us understand this with an example. Tea and coffee are substitute goods. If the price of tea rises, consumers will shift to coffee.

This will decrease the demand for tea and increase the demand for coffee. Thus, the demand curve of tea will slope downwards.
### **3. Income effect**
Income effect refers to the change in the real income or the purchasing power of the consumers. When the price level falls the purchasing power of the consumer’s increases and they buy more goods.

Similarly, when the price level rises, the purchasing power of the consumer’s decreases and they buy less quantity of goods.
### **4. New buyers**
Due to the fall in the prices of a commodity new buyers get attracted towards it and buy it. Thus, this increases the demand for the commodity.
### **5. Old buyers**
When the prices of the goods fall the old buyers tend to buy more goods than usual thereby increasing its demand. This causes the downward sloping of demand curve.
# Law of Demand
Law of Demand states that there is an inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded of a commodity, keeping other factors constant or ceteris paribus. It is also known as the** First Law of Purchase**.** 

- (Ceteris paribus is a Latin phrase that generally means "all other things being equal)."

There are several other factors besides the price of the given commodity that affect the quantity demanded of a commodity. Therefore, in order to understand the separate influence of one factor affecting the demand, it is essential that the other factors are kept constant. Hence, under the Law of Demand, it is assumed that other factors are constant. 

### **Points to Remember:**
- The Law of Demand states that, everything else being constant**,** the quantity demanded of a goods or services decreases as its prices increases, and vice versa.
- The demand curve typically **slopes downward from left to right**, illustrating the negative correlation between price and quantity demanded.
- The Law of Demand applies both at the individual consumer level and across the entire market.
- The Law of Demand is often linked to the concept of diminishing marginal utility, which suggests that as consumers consume more units of a good, the additional satisfaction derived from each additional unit decreases.
- Maths.
## Exceptions to Law of Demand
**1.Giffen Goods:** The special kind of inferior goods on which the consumers spend a big part of their income are known as Giffen Goods. The demand for these goods increases with an increase in price and falls with a decrease in price. This phenomenon was initially observed by **Sir Robert Giffen** and is popularly known as **Giffen’s Paradox**. 

**For example,** rice is an inferior good and wheat is a normal good. Hence, if the price of rice falls, the consumer will spend less on rice and will start buying more wheat.

**2. Fear of Shortage:** If the consumers expect that a commodity will become scarce in the near future, they will start buying more of it in the present, even if the price of the commodity rises because of the fear of its shortage and rise in its price in the future. 

**For example,** in the initial period of COVID, consumers demanded more of the necessity goods like wheat, pulses, etc., even at a higher price due to their fear of general insecurity and shortage in the near future. 

**3. Status Symbol or Goods of Ostentation:** Another exception to the law of demand is the goods that are used as status symbols by the people. 

**For example,** people buy goods like antique paintings because of the status symbol they want to maintain. They demand antique paintings only because their price is high. 

**4. Ignorance:** Sometimes consumers are unaware of the prevailing price of a good in the market. In such cases, they buy more of a commodity, even at a higher price. 

**5. Necessities of Life:** The commodities which are necessary for human life have more demand no matter whether their price reduces or increases. **For example,** demand for necessity goods like medicines, pulses, wheat, etc., will increase, even if their price increases.

**6. Change in Weather:** When there is a change in the weather, demand for some goods changes, even if their price increases. **For example,** demand for raincoats in the rainy season increases, even if their price increases.

**7. Fashion-related goods:**  The goods related to fashion are demanded more, even when their price is high. **For example,** if a specific model of Mobile Phone is in fashion, then consumers will buy it, even if its price increases. 

Demand Function in Economics: A demand function is a mathematical representation of the relationship between the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy and the factors that influence that quantity. In most cases, the primary factor influencing demand is the price of the good or service. However, other factors like consumer income, preferences, and the prices of related goods can also affect demand. 

The general form of a demand function is: 

Q = f (P, Y, X1, X2, ...) 

Where: 

• Q represents the quantity demanded. 

• P represents the price of the good or service. 

• Y represents consumer income. 

• X1, X2, ... represent other factors that can influence demand
