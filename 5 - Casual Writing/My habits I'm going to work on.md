The habit I'm going to work on first is [[Breathing]]
* Breathing : I will use 4-7-8 breathing technique.
  It means you inhale air through your nose for 4 seconds. Then you hold your breathe for 7 seconds. Then exhale slowly through the mouth while making gentle whoosh sound for 8 seconds. I will do it for 5 times in one go.
  * It will increase my $\ce{O2}$ level in my blood and make my $\ce{CO2}$ flow smoother.
  * It will increase my lung capacity.
  * It will help lower my blood pressure and reduce my anxiety.
The next habit I will work on is
