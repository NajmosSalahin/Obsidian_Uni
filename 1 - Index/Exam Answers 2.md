### Definitions with Examples:

**Economics:**  
Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The study of economics is primarily concerned with analyzing the choices that individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make to allocate limited resources.  
Lionel Robbins said the following about the subject: “Economics is the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.”  
*(No specific example provided in the document.)*

**Microeconomics:**  
The term microeconomics is derived from the Greek word ‘mikros’ meaning ‘small.’ The microeconomics deals with the analysis of small individual units of individual firms and small aggregate or groups of individual units such as various industries and markets.  
According to Prof. K. E. Boulding. “Microeconomics deals with the study of individual enterprises, particular homes, individual price, stipend, income, individual diligence, and particular goods.”  
*(No specific example provided in the document.)*

**Macroeconomics:**  
The term macroeconomics is derived from the Greek word ‘makros’meaning‘large.’ The macroeconomics concerns itself with the analysis of the economy as a whole and its large aggregates such as total output and income, total employment, total consumption, aggregate investment.  
According to K.E.Boulding “Macroeconomics deals not with individual quantities as such put with the aggregates of these quantities not with individual incomes but with the national income; not with individual output but with the national output.”  
*(No specific example provided in the document.)*

**Opportunity Cost:**  
The opportunity cost of a particular action is the loss of next best alternative that is a sacrificed opportunity is called an opportunity cost.  
*(No specific example provided in the document, but referenced in the PPC context: For instance, producing five units of wine and five units of cotton (point B) is just as attainable as producing three units of wine and seven units of cotton.)*

**Scarcity:**  
Scarcity:Scarcity is the conditionthat exists when there is an insufficient quantity of resources to produce all the goods derived by people. We can say another way; scarcity derives from the combination of limited resources and unlimited wants.  
*(No specific example provided in the document.)*

**Production Possibility Curve:**  
Production possibility curve:Production possibility curve is a curve representing the maximum possible output combinations of goods that can be produced with a fixed quantity of resources and current level of technology.  
*Example: Imagine a national economy that can produce only two things: wine and cotton. If points A, B, and C are plotted on a curve, it represents the economy’s most efficient use of resources.*

**Positive Economics:**  
Positive economics is the branch of economics that concerns the description and explanation of economic phenomena. It focuses on facts and cause and effect behavioral relationship includes the development and testing of economics theories. Earlier terms were value free economics.  
*Example: The government has introduced a road tax of $10 for all motorists passing a certain road. This road tax has reduced the number of motorists on that road by 20%. Traffic congestion is reduced on that particular road. The travel time for motorists is reduced.*

**Normative Economics:**  
Normative economics is a plant of economics that expresses value or normative judgements about economic fairness or what the outcome of the economy or goals public policy ought to be.  
*Example: The government is right to introduce a road tax of $10 on all motorists passing a certain road. This road tax is harmful for motorists. This road tax is beneficial for the government. The government should not impose the road tax. The government is wrong in imposing the road tax.*

**Merit Goods:**  
Merit goods are the goods that are provided generally by the government to certain sections of the society. Unlike in the case of pure public goods, the merit goods are not provided to the entire society; rather they are given to certain targeted people. The government here believes that the deserving people may under-consume such goods and hence provides these to them at low cost or no cost.  
*Examples: Merit goods include primary education, basic health care, life insurance to poor people etc. The merit goods under two categories- Merit I and Merit II, in terms of their priority. Merit I – Elementary education, primary healthcare, prevention and control of diseases, social welfare and nutrition, soil and water conservation, ecology, and environment. Merit II – Education (other than elementary), sports and youth services, family welfare, urban development, forestry, agricultural research and education, other agricultural programmes, special programmes for rural development, land reforms, other rural development programmes, special programmes for north-eastern areas, flood control and drainage, non-convention energy, village and small industries, ports and light houses, roads and bridges, inland water transport, atomic energy research, space research, oceanographic research, other scientific research, census surveys and statistics, and meteorology.*

**Demerit Goods:**  
A demerit good is a good whose consumption leaves a negative impact on its consumer and on others in the society.  
*Example: An example for demerit good is alcohol. Consumption of alcohol can cause health problems for the drinker. Besides this personal cost, it also leads to external costs as the taxpayer may have to pay for the drunkard consumer’s healthcare as a result. If it is over consumed the marginal social costs exceed marginal private(drunkard’s) costs, due to the external costs imposed on society. Hence a high tax should be imposed on de-merit goods.*

**Public Goods:**  
Public goods refer to those goods which satisfy public wants. The main attribute of public good is that they are supplied by the government jointly for the entire public. Main features of public goods are non-exclusion, non-rivalry and indivisibility.  
*Examples: Examples for public goods are defense services, pollution control, streetlight etc.*

**Private Goods:**  
*(Not explicitly defined in the document.)*

**Social Goods:**  
Social goods: are goods with non-exclusion principle and their supply is jointly made.  
*(No specific example provided in the document, but contrasted with merit goods: In the case of social wants, the goods are provided to all sections of the society (road, defense).)*

**Command Economy:**  
Command Economy – A command economy is an economy in which the government controls all economic activity and transactions.  
*Example: A country with a communist government is an example of a command economy.*

**Market Economy:**  
Market Economy – A market economy is free of all government control. “The economic outcomes are determined by the market forces and the so called ‘invisible hand,’ to use a term coined by philosopher Adam Smith,” Yates said. The invisible hand is a metaphor commonly-used among economists to describe how market forces work together.  
*(No specific example provided in the document.)*

**Mixed Economy:**  
Mixed Economy – This is a hybrid between the command and market economic systems. A mixed economy can be more command or more mixed depending on the government in question. “Most economies in the world are mixed economies, including the United States,” Yates said.  
*(No specific example provided in the document.)*

2. What are the Basic problems of our economy?  
Basic Problem of our economy: 

The basic problems of an economy often emerge from the necessity to make decisions 
due to limited means. This problem emerges because people have endless desires, yet the 
means open to meet those desires are limited. Consequently, meeting all human desires 
becomes difficult when faced with limited resources. 

If resources were infinite or had only a singular goal, the economic problem might not 
exist. However, whether its natural resources, man-made wealth, market goods, money, 
or time, scarcity remains the core problem.  

• 1. What to Produce? 
• 
This means that society must decide which goods and in what quantities should be 
produced. A common example of this problem is often described as the choice between 
“guns or butter,” stressing the decision society faces due to the shortage of resources. 
However, the decision-making problem goes beyond the division of military and civilian 
things. 

• 
Society must also make choices among different market goods, choosing how resources 
are shared among them. Particularly important in this context is the choice between 
basics and pleasures. Additionally, a vital decision in the production of goods and 
resource sharing includes choosing the amounts of both consumer goods and capital 
goods to be created.  

• 2. How to Produce? 
• 
This shows the decision a society makes regarding the mix of materials to produce things. 
The mix of materials suggests a particular production process. Typically, there are 
various different ways of production, and society must make a selection among them. 
Each method uses a different mix of resources, such as labor and cash. For instance, 
cotton cloth can be made using either a handloom or different ways.  

• 3. For Whom to Produce? 
• 
Determining consumers of public resources includes choosing how these goods should be 
divided among the members of society. Given the scarcity of useful resources and the 
resulting limited production, it is impossible to meet all the wants of every person. 
Consequently, society must make choices about the division of the total output of work 
and things among its members. 
• 
In a free economy, the sharing of the public output is set by people’s monetary wages. 
The amount of public goods an individual can gain from the market is directly linked to 
their financial income. Thus, the bigger an individual’s monetary income, the more things 
they can buy. Consequently, bigger differences in the distribution of monetary earnings 
lead to greater inequalities in the distribution of public goods.  

• 4.What to Do for Economic Growth? 
• 
Can a society afford to use all its resources for immediate consumption? Well, yes, it 
could be possible, but unlikely. The reasoning is simple: a society that would consume all 
the resources to the current consumption would hinder the growth of production capacity. 
• 
As a result, the standard of living and the wealth of a person within the society would be 
maintained. It would also reduce living standards in future. As such, society must choose 
the share of resources that it plans to set aside towards future developments.  

• Free Price Mechanism to Solve Basic Problems of an Economy 
• 
The price mechanism is a method of shaping the choices made by people in an economy 
by counting on prices set through the exchange of demand and supply in the market. 
• 
This method works independently of government meddling. When market forces of 
demand and supply reach equilibrium—where the quantity given equals the amount 
demanded—the price of a product is set. 
• 
The price system not only helps in determining the cost of things but also plays a crucial 
role in allocating resources, leading spending and production choices, and setting 
amounts of savings and factor income. This method is mainly noticed in a capitalist 
economic context.  

3. What is market Failure? Cause and control of market failure?  
What is Market Failure? 

Market failure refers to the inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free 
market. In a typical free market, the prices of goods and services are determined by 
the forces of supply and demand, and any change in one of the forces results in a 
price change and a corresponding change in the other force. The changes lead to a 
price equilibrium. 

Causes of Market Failures 

Market failure may occur in the market for several reasons, including: 

1. Externality 

An externality refers to a cost or benefit resulting from a transaction that affects a 
third party that did not decide to be associated with the benefit or cost. It can be 
positive or negative. A positive externality provides a positive effect on the third 
party. F or example, providing good public education mainly benefits the students, 
but the benefits of this public good will spill over to the whole society. 

On the other hand, a negative externality is a negative effect resulting from the 
consumption of a product, and that results in a negative impact on a third party. For 
example, even though cigarette smoking is primarily harmful to a smoker, it also 
causes a negative health impact on people around the smoker. 

2. Public goods 

Public goods are goods that are consumed by a large number of the population, and 
their cost does not increase with the increase in the number of consumers. Public 
goods are both non-rivalrous as well as non-excludable. Non-rivalrous 
consumption means that the goods are allocated efficiently to the whole population 
if provided at zero cost, while non-excludable consumption means that the public 
goods cannot exclude non-payers from its consumption. 

Public goods create market failures if a section of the population that consumes the 
goods fails to pay but continues using the good as actual payers. For example, 
police service is a public good that every citizen is entitled to enjoy, regardless of 
whether or not they pay taxes to the government. 

3. Market control 

Market control occurs when either the buyer or the seller possesses the power to 
determine the price of goods or services in a market. The power prevents the 
natural forces of demand and supply from setting the prices of goods in the market. 

On the supply side, the sellers may control the prices of goods and services if there 
are only a few large sellers (oligopoly) or a single large seller (monopoly). The 
sellers may collude to set higher prices to maximize their returns. The sellers may 
also control the quantity of goods produced in the market and may collude to 
create scarcity and increase the prices of commodities. 

On the demand side, the buyers possess the power to control the prices of goods if 
the market only comprises a single large buyer (monopsony) or a few large buyers 
(oligopsony). If there is only a single or a handful of large buyers, the buyers may 
exercise their dominance by colluding to set the price at which they are willing to 
buy the products from the producers. The practice prevents the market from 
equating the supply of goods and services to their demand. 

4. Imperfect information in the market 

Market failure may also result from the lack of appropriate information among the 
buyers or sellers. This means that the price of demand or supply does not reflect all 
the benefits or opportunity cost of a good. The lack of information on the buyer’s 
side may mean that the buyer may be willing to pay a higher or lower price for the 
product because they don’t know its actual benefits. 

On the other hand, inadequate information on the seller’s side may mean that they 
may be willing to accept a higher or lower price for the product than the actual 
opportunity cost of producing it. 

Solutions to Market Failures 

In order to eliminate market failures, several remedies can be implemented. They 
include: 

1. Use of legislation 

One of the ways that governments can manage market failures is by implementing 
legislation that changes behavior. For example, the government can ban cars from 
operating in city centers, or impose high penalties to businesses that sell alcohol to 
underage children, since the measures control unwanted behaviors. 

2. Price mechanism 

Price mechanisms are designed to change the behavior of both the consumers and 
producers. For products that cause harm to consumers, the government can 
discourage their consumption by increasing taxes. For example, taxes on cigarettes 
and alcohol are periodically increased to discourage their consumption and reduce 
their harmful effects on unrelated third parties. 

4. Which Economics System is the best and why?  
Which economic system is best and why? 

Yates said that most economists favor a market-based economy where the price system 
determines the outcomes of all market transactions. “In a market-based system, every player 
enters voluntarily in the transactions if they agree on the price,” she said.  

The government sometimes intervenes in the economy to resolve inefficiencies caused by two 
factors, according to Yates: 

• 
Externalities – These include positive or negative effects caused by transactions, such as 
pollution caused by driving cars. 

• 
Inequalities – These include situations such as lower wage earners not being able to 
afford rents, so the government may intervene with rent control or subsidies. Similarly, 
the government may intervene with unemployment or disability benefits when someone 
loses their job or is otherwise unable to work. 

“Most economies either have a mixed market system or are migrating toward one, like China," 
she said. She feels this is an indication that a mixed market system seems to work the best.

6. Explain the types of factors of economy.  
Factors of Production: 

Anything that helps in production is the factor of production. These are the various factors by 
mean any resource is transformed into a more useful commodity or service. 

They are the inputs for the process of production. They are the starting point of the production 
process. Factors of production are the parameters which affect the output of production. 

Types of Factors of Production 

Factors of production have been categorized into four types. 

Land 

It refers to all natural resources. All natural resources either on the surface of the earth or below 
the surface of the earth or above the surface of the earth is Land. 

One uses the land to produces goods. It is the primary and natural factor of production. All gifts 
of nature such as rivers, oceans, land, climate, mountains, mines, forests etc. are land. 

The payment for land is rent. 

Characteristics of Land as a Factor of Production 

• 
The land is a free gift of nature. 
• 
 The land has no cost of production. 
• 
It is immobile. 
• 
The land is fixed and limited in supply. 

Types of Land 

1. Residential 
2. Commercial 
3. Recreation 
4. Cultivation 
5. Extraction 
6. Uninhabitable 

Labor 

All human effort that assists in production is labour. This effort can be mental or physical. It is a 
human factor of production. It is the worker who applies their efforts, abilities, and skills to 
produce. 

The payment for labour is the wage. 

Characteristic 

• 
It is a human factor. 
• 
One cannot store labour. 
• 
No two types of labour are the same. 

Types of Labor 

1. Unskilled 
2. Semi-skilled 
3. Skilled 
4. Professional 

Capital 

Capital refers to all manmade resources used in the production process. It is a produced factor of 
production. It includes factories, machinery, tools, equipment, raw materials, wealth etc. 

The payment for capital is interest. 

Characteristics 

• 
Capital is a manmade factor of production. 
• 
It is mobile. 
• 
It is a passive factor of production. 

Types o  f Capital 

1. Fixed 
2. Working 
3. Venture 

Entrepreneur 

An entrepreneur is a person who brings other factors of production in one place. He uses them 
for the production process. He is the person who decides 

• 
What to produce 
• 
Where to produce 
• 
How to produce 

A person who takes these decisions along with the associated risk is an entrepreneur. 

The payment for land is profit. 

Characteristics 

• 
He has imagination. 
• 
He has great administrative power. 
• 
An entrepreneur must be a man of action. 
• 
An entrepreneur must have the ability to organize. 
• 
He should be a knowledgeable person. 
• 
He must have a professional approach.
