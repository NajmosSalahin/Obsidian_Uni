  - **Immediate Wake-Up Sub-Block (5:45-5:55 AM)**
    - Drink a glass of water mindfully (5:45-5:48 AM): Pre-fill the glass nightly. Sip slowly while focusing on hydration (rehydrates and boosts clarity).
    - Make your bed (5:48-5:50 AM): A quick straighten for that initial win and momentum.
    - Fresh up (5:50-5:55 AM): Pee and facewash for refreshing start.

  - **Prep Sub-Block (6:10-6:15 AM)**

    - Prepare for uni by reading books, slides, or notes for classes/exams (20 minutes): E.g., skim lecture slides, review textbook chapters, or highlight key exam concepts. Use apps like Notion or PDF readers; this builds retention and reduces cramming later.

  - **Bus Ride Sub-Block (8:00-9:00 AM)** (Simplified for rest)
    - Do nothing or read uni notes (60 minutes): Alternateâ€”spend 20 minutes doing nothing (stare out window for mindfulness), 20 minutes reading notes/slides for class prep, and another 20 minutes doing nothing. Keeps it simple, reduces stress, and reinforces learning without overload.
